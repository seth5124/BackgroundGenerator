			<Text>Your keen intellect has always been an asset in your studies of the alchemical arts, but along with your logic and rationale, you have a “sense” for alchemy.

			<Name>Wasn't String Enough</Name>
			<Text>You suffered something at an early age that made you feel powerless. Maybe a relative died from plague, a friend was crushed beneath rubble you were too weak to move, or some other horrible tragedy occurred.

			<Name>Magic for the Uninclined</Name>
			<Text>You were always interested in the arcane, but lacked the innate magic of sorcerers or the single-minded dedication possessed by wizards. As a disciple of science, the magic of faith was also closed to you. You dedicated yourself to alchemy, focusing on extracts that mimic the magic you once hoped to wield. That original interest in magic still grants you occasional rare insight into the workings of your formulae. </Text>

			<Name>Physician</Name>
			<Text>Alchemy was the natural outgrowth of your time spent learning the healer’s craft. Your first extracts were the accidental byproduct of making poultices and elixirs.

Though others in your craft come up with ways to substitute certain ingredients when making bombs or mutagens, you disdain such practices, deeming them pollutions. To you, there is always a perfect ingredient and its addition makes your alchemy more potent.</Text>

			<Name>Nature's Foe</Name>
			<Text>You lost something or someone important to you through the cruel indifference of nature. Perhaps you watched someone get swallowed by a storm-tossed sea or witnessed a summer forest fire destroy your home and all of your possessions. No matter the impetus, the unpredictability of nature made you feel small and helpless. Your subsequent devotion to alchemy has been in no small part due to a desire to exert control over nature itself, a domineering intent palpable to all creatures of nature.</Text>

			<Name>To Recreate a Miracle</Name>
			<Text>Your life or the life of someone you loved was saved by a magical elixir. Witnessing this instilled a sense of awe for the art of alchemy.

In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you rage, a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you’re going down, you’re taking everyone with you. </Text>

You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that’s how you like it.</Text>
